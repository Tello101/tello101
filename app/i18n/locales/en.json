        "Decide on your lesson focus. Let your tutor know what you'd like to work on (e.g., pronunciation, business English, casual conversation).",
        "Review any assigned materials. If your tutor provides pre-lesson materials, take some time to go through them.",
        "Ensure a quiet environment. Using a headset and sitting in a distraction-free space can help you get the most out of your lesson.",
