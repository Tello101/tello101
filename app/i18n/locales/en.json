				"If you cancel a lesson less than 24 hours before the start time, the lesson will be deducted from your balance as if it had been completed.",
				"To cancel or reschedule, simply log in to your account, navigate to your upcoming lessons, and select a new time that works for you."
			]
		},
		"question_2": {
			"question": "2. What happens if my tutor cancels a lesson?",
			"answer": [
				"If your tutor cancels a lesson for any reason, you will not lose the lesson, and you will have the flexibility to reschedule with the same tutor or a different tutor at a time that works for you.",
				"We strive to ensure reliability and consistency in our tutoring services, and tutor cancellations are rare. However, if your tutor is unavailable, you will be notified in advance, and you can rebook your lesson at your convenience."
			]
		},
		"question_3": {
			"question": "3. Is there an expiry date for the lessons?",
			"answer": [
				"Yes, lessons must be used within the specified validity period. Each lesson package has a different expiration period depending on the type of package purchased, so please check the details carefully on our Tutor [hyperlinked] page before making a purchase.",

			]
		},
		"question_4": {
			"question": "4. Can I change my tutor?",
			"answer": [
				"Yes! When you purchase lessons, you are not committing to a specific tutor. Instead, you are free to book lessons with different tutors at any time based on your preferences and learning needs.",
				"We encourage students to try different tutors to gain exposure to a variety of teaching styles, backgrounds, and perspectives. This can be particularly beneficial for improving adaptability in real-world Australian conversations.",
				"If you find a tutor that you enjoy working with, you are welcome to continue booking lessons with them. However, if you'd like to try a new tutor at any time, you can easily do so through our booking system."
			]
		},
		"question_5": {
			"question": "5. What happens if I'm late to a lesson?",
			"answer": [
				"If you are late, your tutor will wait for you for up to 10 minutes for a 25 minute lesson and 20 minutes for a 50 minute lesson. However, the lesson will still end at the originally scheduled time. If you do not join the lesson within this time, the lesson will be considered completed and deducted from your balance.",

			"answer": [
				"If you encounter technical difficulties (e.g., internet connection problems, microphone issues), please try to resolve them as quickly as possible.",
				"If the issue occurs on your side and prevents you from completing the lesson, the lesson will be counted as used.",
				"If the issue is on the tutor's side or our platform's side, you will not lose the lesson and will be given the option to reschedule.",

		"question_7": {
			"question": "7. Do I need to prepare anything before my lesson?",
			"answer": [
				"While our tutors will guide you through each session, we recommend that you:",
				"Decide on your lesson focus. Let your tutor know what you'd like to work on (e.g., pronunciation, business English, casual conversation).",
				"Review any assigned materials. If your tutor provides pre-lesson materials, take some time to go through them.",
				"Ensure a quiet environment. Using a headset and sitting in a distraction-free space can help you get the most out of your lesson.",
				"If you're unsure what to focus on, don't worry—your tutor will help tailor the lesson to your needs."

			"question": "10. What if I'm not satisfied with my tutor?",
			"answer": [

			"answer": [
				"Yes! Many of our tutors have backgrounds in various professional fields, such as finance, law, technology, healthcare, and education. While all tutors can assist with general English, some may be better suited for industry-specific English or professional communication.",
